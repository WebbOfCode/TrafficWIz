# OVERVIEW
This project analyzes traffic congestion and accident patterns using a database-driven approach. We will combine real-world traffic data with SQL and Python to discover insights, visualize trends, and design a simple interface that allows users to explore problem areas.

# TOOLS THAT WILL BE USED
- MySQL (For structured storage)
- Python (For querying and analysis)
- API's and CSV Datasets (To get traffic data)
- Matpotlib (For data visualization)

# OBJECTIVES
- Collect real-time and historical traffic datasets from open APIs.
- Design and implement a relational database schema for storing traffic incidents, congestion, and weather conditions.
- Query the database using MySQL and integrate queries with Python for deeper analysis.
- Build an interactive dashboard/website that displays traffic insights.
- Build a predictive model (machine learning) for traffic delay/accident prediction.
